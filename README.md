## Description

This project serves as my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills, and experiences. It is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

3. Install the dependencies using npm:
